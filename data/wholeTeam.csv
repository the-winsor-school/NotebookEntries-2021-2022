9/11/2021,20409,DYEING!,"today we dyed a lot of wheels! we had to plan out the shades with the whiteboard, and its goin a little chaotically, because its very time based. We're still working on the darkest shade as of now","A lot of time- based challenges, we've been accidentally making batches of 4 so AHH","We need to create 4 more medium light shade, and maybe a even lighter shade, we're leaving 8 rollers in over night to see if it gets any darker","Eleni, Haley, Liza and others!"
9/17/2021,13620,Fixing the Robot,"Today, we worked on making some fixes for the robot tomorrow. We repaired the ramp, tested code, and adjusted the encoder wheel. ","Part of the robot broke more while we were fixing the ramp, but we enlisted the help of the building team to make the necessary repairs.",We will see how well the robot does in the kickoff tomorrow!,"Abby B, Liza, and others!"
9/24/2021,Both,Brainstorming,"Group 1: Today we worked on generating ideas for the robot. We thought we should make mechanum tank treads, a cameravision sensor, and a arm ",We took some time to develop an idea and get it on paper,"We will need to figure out if our tank tread can work without mechanum wheels, as well as gain support for our idea.","Abby B, Anaya, Romy, Eva, Amber"
9/24/2021,Both,Brainstorming,Group 2: Today we had a brainstorming session and came up with lots of input designs. We narrowed it down to four of our favorites. We also watched some videos for reference and discussed strategy.,Coming up with new ideas was difficult. We also ran out of steam because we were all very tired.,"Narrow down our designs further, come up with output, spinny, and wheel designs","Liza, Haley, Trisha, Christina, Emily"
9/24/2021,Both,Brainstorming,"Group 3: First, we brainstormed which tasks to complete to optimize points. Than, we worked on designs for the robot. We mainly focused on designign the intake mechanisms. we starred our favorite ideas, and focused more on them. We like the Fred collecter, reverse claw machine, tennis ball thing, and the wheel mechanism to turn the carousel.","It was hard to design a robot which can complete multiple differnt tasks, and were were sometimes confused about game rules","We will select designs we like most, and go more in depth in designing them. We will work on revising, and beggining to prototype them. ","Julia, Anita, Laurel, Audrey C"
9/24/2021,Both,Brainstorming,"Group 5: We thought about strategy for the autonomous, teleop, and end game periods considering both points and ease of building and coding. We also reflected on which sensors would be most useful and then brainstormed potential mechs for each of the tasks.","We had some questions about the game rules, and we had some trouble envision which ideas would be both practical and feasible ","Reviewing ideas and attempting to prototype, testing and revising","Sophia L., Audrey W., Julia B, Camille"
9/25/2021,Both,Brainstorming,"Coding differentation methods (for picking up cubes/spheres): We thought about different ways the robot could communicate the weight of the cargo to the drivers. Discussed weight sensors, color sensors, and magnetic sensor. We decided that a kind of weight sensor would probably work best. ","We weren't sure what the weights of the spheres and cubes are. We didn't get very far on discussing types of weight sensors, which is kind of important.",Weigh different cubes and spheres. Decide on a method to differentiate between the four.,"Sofia GB, Laurence, Trisha, Christina, Amber"
9/25/2021,Both,adventuring.,today i adventured the three seas of the subteams! I started with building and wrote some stuff down on the board! Then I sauntered over to the lovely world of business and took some pictures and vlogged! and then i went to coding and looked at their wonderful board of ideas! yay,i struggled with focusing the camera!,I'm gonna get better at photography!,Liza :)
11/20/2021,Both,Diagrams,Today we created diagrams for how we wanted all of our various mechanisms to fit together on one robot. We drew two diagrams from various perspectives for both robots. We then realized that the intake mechanisms that the two teams had created would work better if they were used on the other chassis. We then created several more diagrams for each robot with the proposed intake switch and intend to present these diagrams to the team.,"We had to figure out what intake mechanism we should use for the tank chassis, because the intake mechanism had not originally been decided for one of the lifting mechanism.",Present to the team and come to a decision.,"Amber, Katie, Abby B"
12/11/2021,Both,Judging Presentations,we started to write judging presentations! we divided up our two teamss and tried to wrie both of them authentically and seperately,"having been 1 team, we struggled with diferentiating our stories ",finish judging presentation,"Bonnie, Liza, Abby, Kenna, Emily"
12/11/2021,Both,Engineering Porfolios,We worked on the building and coding sections of both notebooks as well as added on to the business sections,It was difficult to work on the liftie portfolio because we aren't as developed building and coding-wise.,Finish both portfolios and the aesthetics,"Anaya, Audrey Wang, Audrey Cheng, Giulia, Sophia, Laurence"
1/7/2022,13620,Judging Presentations,We finished drafting our judging presentation script!,Its a little long (over 7 minutes)!,"Edit thoroughly and cut down some things, practice with the team","Abby B, Audrey C, Karla, Camille, Julia, Eleni, Anita, Katie, Yuyuan"
1/7/2022,13620,Notebook/Portfolio,"We added some details about robot strategy, coding information, build mechanisms, and mentor information to our portfolio!","It was a challenge to write about some of the mechanisms that still weren't fully designed or attached to the robot, and the code that hadn't been written/tested yet.","We still need to write the sections before the entries, and also manually create entries in canva for the general entries (mostly on brainstorming)","Karla, Camille, Julia, Eleni, Anita, Katie, Yuyuan"
1/7/2022,20409,Judging Presentations,"We continued to draft the judging presentation script, working off of the notes written out and collaborating with each other on details and content","We weren't able to finish the script, but it already looks like it will be too long","Finish drafting judging presentation script, shorten sections that are too long","Anaya, Karina, Audrey W, Emily, Alyssa, Giulia, Haley, Liza, Romy, Katie, Abby B."
1/7/2022,20409,Notebook/Portfolio,"We mainly worked on the strategy, brainstorming, and coding pages (adding diagrams and text), but we also made some tweaks to the other pages.","There aren't many photos of our robot, designs, or of our code, and the design of our newer pages need work. We're missing some details on the building/coding front","Take more photos of our robot, its mechanisms, and our brainstorming process","Anaya, Karina, Audrey W, Emily, Alyssa, Giulia, Haley"
1/7/2022,Both,Engineering Notebook,We went through all of the engineering notebook entries and confirmed that they were complete and ready to be formatted.  ,There were some entries that had been deleted so we had to search through the document entry to find what they had originally been,Format the engineering notebook on Canva!,"Eva, Liza, Trisha, Romy, Anita, Abby B, Katie "
1/29/2022,13620,Portfolio,"Virtual Snow Day Meeting! We worked on the mechanisms, strategy, and coding pages of the portfolio. We also condensed our portfolio from 17 pages to 14 by formatting","There are some photos that we don't have yet, and we weren't able to take any pictures because this meeting was virtual (we're getting 15 inches of snow!!)","Take photos of different mechanisms of the robot and the shipping elements and then add them into the specific pages that need them. If needed, we can add an extra page to reach the 15 page limit.","Anaya, Eleni, Jolie, Katie, Karla, Abby B, Audrey C"
1/29/2022,20409,Portfolio,We worked on filling in and solidifying our strategy for the game (on pg nine of the portfolio),"Working on the strategy page made us realize that we as a team haven't really decided whether to prioritize the shared shipping hub or alliance shipping hub, which led to some math (around point values and stuff)","Test auton to see how much of our ideal strategy we can achieve, and chip off what seems like we won't be able to achieve in the time we have","Bonnie, Liza, Haley"
1/29/2022,Both,Practice answering judge questions,"Because of the nor'easter, we were unable to meet in person and so we decided to use the rest of our virtual snow day meeting for judging practice. We practiced answering possible judging questions (from a very colorful slideshow :) ) in three separate breakout rooms, and then we came together in the main zoom room to share our responses",So many things to talk about and so many stories we want to share,Continue practicing our responses to judging questions in preparation for the first qualifier!,"Audrey C, Anaya, Abby B, Bonnie, Eleni, Haley, Jolie, Katie, Liza, Karla"
