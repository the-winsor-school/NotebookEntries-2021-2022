9/11/2021,Fill In,DYEING!,"today we dyed a lot of wheels! we had to plan out the shades with the whiteboard, and its goin a little chaotically, because its very time based. We're still working on the darkest shade as of now","A lot of time- based challenges, we've been accidentally making batches of 4 so AHH","We need to create 4 more medium light shade, and maybe a even lighter shade, we're leaving 8 rollers in over night to see if it gets any darker","Eleni, Haley, Liza and others!"
9/17/2021,Fill In,Fixing the Robot,"Today, we worked on making some fixes for the robot tomorrow. We repaired the ramp, tested code, and adjusted the encoder wheel. ","Part of the robot broke more while we were fixing the ramp, but we enlisted the help of the building team to make the necessary repairs.",We will see how well the robot does in the kickoff tomorrow!,"Abby B, Liza, and others!"
9/24/2021,Fill In,Brainstorming,"Group 1: Today we worked on generating ideas for the robot. We thought we should make mechanum tank treads, a cameravision sensor, and a arm ",We took some time to develop an idea and get it on paper,"We will need to figure out if our tank tread can work without mechanum wheels, as well as gain support for our idea.","Abby B, Anaya, Romy, Eva, Amber"
9/24/2021,Fill In,Brainstorming,Group 2: Today we had a brainstorming session and came up with lots of input designs. We narrowed it down to four of our favorites. We also watched some videos for reference and discussed strategy.,Coming up with new ideas was difficult. We also ran out of steam because we were all very tired.,"Narrow down our designs further, come up with output, spinny, and wheel designs","Liza, Haley, Trisha, Christina, Emily"
9/24/2021,Fill In,Brainstorming,"Group 3: First, we brainstormed which tasks to complete to optimize points. Than, we worked on designs for the robot. We mainly focused on designign the intake mechanisms. we starred our favorite ideas, and focused more on them. We like the Fred collecter, reverse claw machine, tennis ball thing, and the wheel mechanism to turn the carousel.","It was hard to design a robot which can complete multiple differnt tasks, and were were sometimes confused about game rules","We will select designs we like most, and go more in depth in designing them. We will work on revising, and beggining to prototype them. ","Julia, Anita, Laurel, Audrey C"
9/24/2021,Fill In,Brainstorming,"Group 5: We thought about strategy for the autonomous, teleop, and end game periods considering both points and ease of building and coding. We also reflected on which sensors would be most useful and then brainstormed potential mechs for each of the tasks.","We had some questions about the game rules, and we had some trouble envision which ideas would be both practical and feasible ","Reviewing ideas and attempting to prototype, testing and revising","Sophia L., Audrey W., Julia B, Camille"
9/25/2021,Fill In,Brainstorming,"Coding differentation methods (for picking up cubes/spheres): We thought about different ways the robot could communicate the weight of the cargo to the drivers. Discussed weight sensors, color sensors, and magnetic sensor. We decided that a kind of weight sensor would probably work best. ","We weren't sure what the weights of the spheres and cubes are. We didn't get very far on discussing types of weight sensors, which is kind of important.",Weigh different cubes and spheres. Decide on a method to differentiate between the four.,"Sofia GB, Laurence, Trisha, Christina, Amber"
9/25/2021,Fill In,adventuring.,today i adventured the three seas of the subteams! I started with building and wrote some stuff down on the board! Then I sauntered over to the lovely world of business and took some pictures and vlogged! and then i went to coding and looked at their wonderful board of ideas! yay,i struggled with focusing the camera!,I'm gonna get better at photography!,Liza :)
11/20/2021,Fill In,Diagrams,Today we created diagrams for how we wanted all of our various mechanisms to fit together on one robot. We drew two diagrams from various perspectives for both robots. We then realized that the intake mechanisms that the two teams had created would work better if they were used on the other chassis. We then created several more diagrams for each robot with the proposed intake switch and intend to present these diagrams to the team.,"We had to figure out what intake mechanism we should use for the tank chassis, because the intake mechanism had not originally been decided for one of the lifting mechanism.",Present to the team and come to a decision.,"Amber, Katie, Abby B"
12/11/2021,Fill In,Judging Presentations,we started to write judging presentations! we divided up our two teamss and tried to wrie both of them authentically and seperately,"having been 1 team, we struggled with diferentiating our stories ",finish judging presentation,"Bonnie, Liza, Abby, Kenna, Emily"
12/11/2021,Fill In,Engineering Porfolios,We worked on the building and coding sections of both notebooks as well as added on to the business sections,It was difficult to work on the liftie portfolio because we aren't as developed building and coding-wise.,Finish both portfolios and the aesthetics,"Anaya, Audrey Wang, Audrey Cheng, Giulia, Sophia, Laurence"
