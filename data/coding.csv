9/11/2021,Both,"Downloading Android Studio, fixing build issues",We downloaded Andriod Studio and walked through our files and libraries from last year. We also set up the new REV Driver Hub. We also created a new repository for this year and deleted the unnecessary code.,We ran into gradle issues and had trouble actually running the code. ,"Fixing gradle issues, start writing code(?) --> starting on OpModes maybe","Bonnie, Abby B, Laurence, Karla, Yuyuan, Emily, Sofia, and Kenna",
9/17/2021,20409,"Fixing code issues from last week, learning how to code","We learned how to make the robot go forward and spin around in autonomous, as well as learning how to use the joysticks in teleop mode.

9/25/2021,Both,Researching and brainstorming localization methods,"We found four localization options: VSLAM, dead reckoner, roadrunner, vuforia. We made a table of pros and cons of each method.",All options/code are pretty complicated. ,Pick an option!,"Abby, Bonnie, Karla",
9/25/2021,Both,Locating and sensing the position of the object on the tapes,We researched online solutions and sensors for object recognition (including TensorFlow strategies and Vuforia ideas). We planned out a few flow plans for color sensors and found a way to identify the position of the object based on rgb value (and possibly some sort of distance).,"rgb values are easy to mess up, and the machine learning algorithms needed to run TensorFlow are pretty complicated. We also need to find a way to adapt to the positioning depending on starting position.","converse with building team about their plans going forward, as well as creating more research about the best type of weight sensor to use","Sophia, Laurence, Amber, Trisha, Christina",

10/1/2021,Both,Prioritizing Problems,"We looked at the tasks of comparing the weight of cubes, finding where the shipping element is placed on the barcode, knowing the weight after it has been sensed, and localization. We then listed the pros and cons of each and figured out which we wanted to concentrate on more.",Certain solutions (such as VSLAM and image processing) were harder to rank because we haven't used them so we don't know how easy it would be for it to work for our robot.,"Diving into sub sub teams to focus on three different issues: localization, barcode detection, and weight of cube detection","Laurence, Eva, Liza, Abby, Kenna, Sophia, Emily",
10/2/2021,13620,Individual Group Work/Differentiation Group,"For the differentation group, we researched different FSR's and their applications to the robot/how to determine the weights and what to do with that information.

10/2/2021,Both,Barcode Group,"we checked out a couple different ways to sense the ducks eg (color sensors, vuforia, and Tensorflow). We decided to pursue tensorflow. We followed This Tutorial. ","We had to get a new vuforia key, we had to deal with lotss of debugging, and we don't know how to see when the sensor sees the skystone. Lots of pproblems overall!!!!! ","We got pretty far - there are no errors, but we still have to figure out how to run it w/telemetry and how to customize it for the duckies.","Emily, Liza",
10/2/2021,20409,Localization Group,"We copied Road Runner and OpenCv repos into the localization branch, and found and printed 3d models for the deadwheel stabilization","There were some issues copying Roadrunner and OpenCv repos into our team code, including finding the localization branch on GitHub","Assemble deadwheels, continue to work on OpenCV and Roadrunner. Redo RoadRunner Method 2 Installation, figure out OpenCV libraries and copy code from Youtube","Karla, Bonnie, Yuyuan, Abby B",
10/8/2021,Both,Barcode Group,"We looked at our code from last week and realized that everything we had done was unnecessary, but we did learn from doing it. We also filled out an application for a beta test of a TensorFlow program from FIRST. ","It was very upsetting to learn that everything we did last time was unnecessary. :( We were also very tired today, and got distracted by weight things. ","Our next step is to sense the ""minerals"". ","Liza, Emily",
10/8/2021,13620,FSR Group,"We sautered the FSR to the wires, connected them to the Control Hub, and began to experiment with the differences between the weights in the boxes",We faced a few challenges with connection issues,"Next time, we would like to make a platform for the pieces so that the weight is more evenly distributed and the sensor is more sensitive and accurate and consistent. Then we hope to take some measurements of each cube and average those to find a general range of what the values should be for each type of cube/sphere.","Sophia, Laurence, Kenna",
10/8/2021,20409,Localization Group,"We connected Roadrunner to our repository, hooked up the wheel encoders to our mechanum wheel chassis, and started running code to calibrate drive constants.","There were some issues getting Roadrunner to actually run, and for a while it was not running and then it ran backwards. Eventually we fixed it and it runs now.","The dead wheels have not arrived yet, so there's still a lot of things we need to do to set up Roadrunner. We also need to keep configuring our drive constants.","Abby B, Kenna",
10/9/2021,13620,FSR Group,"We measured and recorded the force of all the cubes. Next, we tried to write a code that would print on the phone whether the cube was light, medium, oir heavy.","So many problems. So many. like I said we had issues with connecting, and having too few control hubs. We also had problems with the vuforia error thing so AH!",Fix vuforia error! and get it to recognize minerals!,"Liza, Kenna, Ella ",
10/9/2021,20409,Localization Group,"Tried to get the dashboard to work, it did not","Google had no answers, the FTC reddit had no answers, old members had no answers, the FTC discord might have had an answer but they didn't respond, looked through dashboard documentation to no avail","Figure it out, I guess ",Abby B,

We think we probably made a logic error.,FIx the code to make it work.,"Karla, Bonnie, Laurence",
10/15/2021,20409,FSR Group - Force Sensitive Resistor,"We took measurements of the weight of the cubes and made code to print whether the box is heavy, medium, or light, to our phone. We also designed and 3D printed a platform for the weight sensor so that the weight of the subes was evenly distributed.",We are not sure how it will integrate with the intake/outake design from building and the box has to be placed relatively centered but it is quite accurate when the box is in a good position.,Continue to communicate with the building group about integrating weight measurement with the intake/outtake system,"Liza, Eva, Sophia",https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6ASYpAj0vSRgRhJWDCIultYhknpUE0-UOAEPbQt_Jw/edit#gid=0
10/15/2021,20409,Localization Group,"Today we added two new deadwheels and encoders!

10/16/2021,Both,Barcode Group,"We successfully downloaded the EasyOpenCV, and decided to make the team barcode thing the color purple, as it worked best to find different for our code","We had a lot of downloading trouble, and also general frustration","Look in the OpenCV github library and try to modify the code, as well as downloading the correct Teleop ","Karla, Amber, Laurence",
10/16/2021,20409,Localization Group,"We finished configuring the encoder wheels, but then had to download a lot of firmware updates for the control hub, expansion hub, and driver controller. After doing that, we measured the x and y constant multipliers for the encoder wheels. ",The control hub and expansion hub needed to be updated so that took a while,Multipliers so the robot will actually go to the distance it says it does,"Ella, Sofia, Yuyuan, Abby",
10/23/2021,Both,Barcode + Strategy Group,"Today we figured out our TensorFlow code and it now works! We also have OpenCV. We think both can help with sensing the ducks and team marker. We have also been accepted into the beta thing!! We will check that out once FIRST posts everything, and we registered the team. We also spent some time strategizing (figuring out all the point values, which to use in different situations, etc.) We 3D printed something with the purple filament and our OpenCV code successfully detected the object.",We had issues with the driver hub's wifi and the vuforia code. We eventually found a new vuforia code that worked. ,"We should try to figure out the timing on our auton strategies and somehow incorporate the OpenCV code into the TensorFlow code. Also, we should brainstorm what our team object (Embezzlement) should look like. ","Emily, Liza, Karla",
10/23/2021,20409,Localization Group,We tested the feed forward tuning to make the actual velocity match the target velocity.,"The robot did not go forward and backward straight which complicated the tuning testing. As well, the velocity graph did not match the target velocity graph.",Write some code to make the robot drive in a straight line. Continue tuning and adjusting each variable one by one.,"Abby, Yuyuan, Sophia, Bonnie, Ella",
10/30/2021,Both,Barcode Group,We read the first part and part 7 of the Beta testing manual. We now know that we have to take a large variety of videos for the beta testing thing (but only have 2 (4) hours of YEAH. We also plugged in the webcam to the computer! we know how to record now! YAY,Only the mentor can actually send in videos :( (LEGALLY). We will do our best with their help! ,We need to create and test our team object before training the TensorFlow to detect it. We also still need a team object (TEXTURED)! We want to use both open cv and tensorflow together,"Emily, Liza, Karla",
10/30/2021,20409,FSR Group - Force Sensitive Resistor,"We tested the intake box with the FSR inside of it, re-measuring all of the objects putting them inside the intake. We tried tissue paper around the FSR to stabalize it and thought of other materials that could possibly work better for differentiation. We tested at what angle the intake should be to get the biggest differentiation between objects, finding that the FSR has to be at 90º to actually create a measurement of the objects other than 0.0. ",Nothing worked lol. There were challenges with both gradle and the angle of the box. Suffering was immense but in the end we ended up with some tiny bits of useful knowledge so yeah,Cooperate with the building team to build a more stable general intake that works with the FSR,"Amber, Laurence",
10/30/2021,20409,Localization group,We tried to fix the code so the robot would go straight when it was driving forward by correcting the direction of the robot using the imu sensor,"On our first few code iterations, the robot spun in circles. We added some negative signs and then it started working.",Continue feedforward velocity tuning now that the robot should theoretically crash into walls less.,"Abby, Bonnie",
10/30/2021,Both,Auton planning,"Drew possible paths for the robot (4 so far!) and made flowcharts for each of them. Path analysis was done and we decided paths 1 and 3 would be our go-to plans (for right side only). Pseudocode should be coming along shortly, as well as more ideas for left side plans.","The left side is very underdeveloped, and lots of the plans on the right side still require knowledge of how well the robot can turn. I will be doing time tests next meeting to fully gauge efficiency.","Develop plans for the left side, work with building team on wheels and turning issues, timing the robot for each of the 4 plans, writing pseudocode",Yuyuan,
11/5/2021,20409,Localization group,"Tuned the different values to straighten out the results, more or less plugged in numbers for 2 hours, and brainstorming ways on plugging in different numbers","Lots of numbers. It was painful. The brakes stopped, the sleep functions were messing up the values, and the dead wheel got moved around a bit when it drove over the barriers","Tune it more, ask mentors for a bit of help. work on the coding a little more (to find a way for the robot to stop slamming into the walls)","Abby, Bonnie, Laurence",
11/5/2021,Both,Shipping Element Group,"We listed all the restrictions of our team shipping element and brainstormed design ideas. we decided to make bb8 and r2d2 shipping elements! we have used mostly tinkerCAD, having downloaded bb8 and r2d2 CADS from the internet.",we realized the shipping element has to be a certain size and needs to have our team numbers on it!,use CAD to add text and 3D print them!,"Emily, Liza",
11/5/2021,Both,Auton group,We finished writing pseudocode for all 4 paths (although path 4 is still a bit of a mess).

11/6/2021,Both,Auton group,We finished writing actual code for all 4 paths (hooray!). Left side was successfully fixed. We need to start doing tests once we get the robot running.,Estimates are probably very off,do testing,"Karla, Sophia, Yuyuan",
11/6/2021,20409,Localization group,"We learned about PID usage fpr tuning, and found that it worked better for us as it accounts for error. We tested it and by the end it is working fairly well","The max velocity measurements were way off, which led us to manually measure it instead, so it's probably a little less accurate than it should be","Continue testing, and work on straightening out the robot's path","Abby, Bonnie, Laurence",
11/6/2021,20409,Arm Code Group,"We code the servos for the arm used for the intake of the freight. We figures out how to code servos in general, and we coded the two sevos on the box to move at the same time.","We did not know how to code servos, but Sophia helped us.",We want to test out code on actual servos and eventually on the actual arm.,"Kenna, Ella, Sophia",
11/6/2021,13620,Shipping element and tankdrive,we finished resizing the team shipping element designs and then we printed them - we didn't get a final result. we had to try this a few times due to printer malfunction. then we started making a version of the driving linrary based on the parameters for the tank treads. after that we wrote more code pertaining to the tank treads,"shipping element sizing and when the printer printed them, there was a malfunction multiple times where it got really messy","fix the printing issues, test the new teleop for tank","Emily, Liza, Sophia",
11/12/2021,20409,Localization group,"We tested our PID tuning only to find that it was still not working. We worked with the building team to adjust one of our deadwheels, and also noticed that one of the mechanum wheels was really structurally loose. We started working with the new tank tread robot and are trying to get that to work.","There were issues with the robot going straight, as seen also during the Straight Test. The odometry wheel also was not having a good day and needed to be fixed, and one of the wheels was found out to be loose","Impliment road runner on new tank tread robot, also maybe fix all of the issues in the mechanum test robot","Laurence, Abby",
11/12/2021,Both,Shipping element,"I tried out the newly printed R2D2 and BB8 shipping elements, but they did not work, so I modified them. I changed the cone-shaped holes to 2x2x2in cylinders.

11/13/2021,13620,Tankdrive,"We made changes to the tankdrive code so that when both joysticks point forward, the robot would go forward, while when both go back the robot moves back and when in opposite directions, the robot spins.",We first changed the gear reductions from two 5:1 (25:1 total) to one 5:1 and one 3:1 (15:1 total). This made the maximum velocity of the robot higher. We also tested different CAD versions of caps for the tank tred pieces. Then we made adjustments to the code for driver usability. ,We want to secure each side of the tank wheels with screws and continue testing the driving controls because the robot does not quite drive in a straight line. We also want to add the texturized caps to the tred pieces. ,"Sophia, Laurence, Eleni",

11/19/2021,20409,Lifting Arm,We completed a prototype of the code for the lifting arm and began working with the building team to test the arm.,"SO MANY PROBLEMS! We had 3 degrees of freedom for the cascading arm to work (which is a lot!) but we figured out a way for us to only have 2 by mounting the arm sideways. Then, we did not have the code from last time, so we had to recreate it. We didn't know how to code motors, but we learned stuff. We also dont have exact measurement which is a problem for tomorrow. ","Test arm and get accurate measurements, so we can have a final code by the end of the day tomorrow. ","Kenna, Karla, Ella",
11/19/2021,Both,Shipping element and webcam,"We took the new R2D2 and BB8 shipping elements and removed all of the supports. Then, we added in felt so that they don't swing around. Finally, we took a look at some of the information for the videos for TensorFlow.","The R2D2 swung around a lot, so we added felt, but the felt didn't work very well.",Keep working on the webcam,"Emily, Yuyuan",
11/20/2021,20409,Lifting Arm,"We continued working on coding the lift arm with the building team. Rotini (motor) seems to be working, but we've had issues with the servos. We started (and almost finished) adding an encoder to the motor. ","We had contunus servos instead of smart servos so all of our servo code wasn't working, but we are reaplcing them so we will be able to start coding the servos correctly.",Finish encoder code + test it. Test new Rev Smart servos with building team.,"Kenna, Karla",
11/20/2021,Both,Shipping elements and TensorFlow,"We added polka dots to the shipping elements so TensorFlow can recognize them more easily. Then, we started testing out the webcam. We recorded lots of footage of all of the normal game pieces, and began preparing them to upload.","We can't get footage of the shipping elements until the magnets are on. Also, the fotage was too long and so we need to slice it up to upload it.","Finish preparing footage and upload, record and upload footage of the shipping elements","Emily, Yuyuan",

12/4/2021,13620,integrating teleOp for Tank,"We coded the arm with two servos and two motors, we added code for tilting back the servo box and getting the weigth with the weight sensor. We also made the arm go up in 3 increements so that it can reach each level.","We tested the code, but the controler for the arm may not have been a working controler because the arm did not move. It may also be a coding issue.  ",Test the controlers and label which ones work. Fix the errors that Laurence wrote down (pic in slack). Finish robot controlers' diagrams. Make sure arm works. ,"Karla, Emily, Kenna, Sophia",
12/4/2021,20409,integrating teleOp for Liftie,We coded the arm with two servos and one motor. We thought about which buttons would be most intuitive for drivers. We created a diagram for the mech operators but liftie's diagram is not finished. ,We have the wrong servos and dont have any more smart servos. And we could not test because the arm wasn't attached to the robot. ,"Attach box to arm, attach arm to robot, and test!","Karla, Emily, Kenna, Sophia",
12/17/2021,Both,Park in warehouse auton,We began to code for both robots to park in warehouse and helped configure and wire the robot,We did not know how to continue with the code for the actual movements of the robots... the distance must be measured in seconds instead of distance and will need testing becasue we have not really solidified driving with encoders,Finish the parking and integrate with other aspects of auton,"Ella, Liza",
12/17/2021,20409,teleop driving tested and made teleop for arm,"I discussed with the building team on how the intake and lifting mechanism would work, and based on that information, I wrote code for lifing the arm and intaking the boxes. I also tested driving on the newly attached wheels, and I wrote a teleOp that only drives.","I ran into some errors with null pointer exceptions and the driving library, so I changed how the setMode function in the driving library works by making the drivingMode variable an enum and adding tertiary operators instead of an array.",Test the whole teleop and make changes accordingly,Sophia,
12/17/2021,13620,"Building removed a servo from one side of the tank, so we fixed the teleOp code to match ","Only one side of the servo intake box is attached to the robot. Previously the code had used servos on two sides of the robot to control where the box was turning, but because building decided to remove one of the servos, we adapted the code so that it also only uses the servo on one side.",We still have not had the chance to test this code.,We would like to calibrate and test this code and maybe have some driver practice time.,"Sophia, Karla",
12/17/2021,Both,Added two more regions of pixels in opencv webcam code,"I edited the opencv code (opencvexample) to add two more regions of pixels so that we can collect data, see the colors of, and detect the team object in three 50x50 pixels areas instead of just one.
